# Auto Redeem

A flexible rescue bot that continuously attempts to withdraw funds from DeFi protocols with limited liquidity.

**Supports multiple rescue modes:**
- **ERC-4626 Vault Redeem** - Works with any ERC-4626 compliant vault
- **Morpho Market Withdraw** - Withdraw liquidity from Morpho markets

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**Always create a fresh, one-time wallet to run this bot. Never use your main wallet's private key.**

**Setup:**
1. Generate a new wallet (bot wallet)
2. Send ETH to bot wallet for gas fees
3. **For Morpho Markets**: Authorize bot at https://www.monarchlend.xyz/tools
4. **For ERC4626 Vaults**: Transfer shares to bot OR approve bot (delegate mode)
5. Set your main wallet as `OWNER` - rescued assets go here

This way, only the bot wallet is at risk, not your main funds.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 or higher) - [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** - Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- **RPC URL** - Get free RPC from [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) or [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoncoding/auto-redeem.git
cd auto-redeem
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run the bot

```bash
pnpm start
```

That's it! The interactive CLI will guide you through everything.

### 3. Gather Required Information

Before starting, you'll need:
- **Bot wallet private key** - Generate a one-time wallet at [vanity-eth.tk](https://vanity-eth.tk/)
- **RPC URL** - Get free RPC from [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) or [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)
- **Vault/Market address** - The contract address where your funds are stuck
- **Owner address** - Your main wallet where rescued funds should go

📖 **[See detailed setup guide](./docs/setup-guide.md)** for step-by-step instructions on getting each of these.

## How It Works

The bot uses an interactive CLI that guides you through the entire setup process:

1. **Select a rescue mode** - Choose between ERC-4626 Vault Redeem or Morpho Market Withdraw
2. **Enter credentials** - Provide your bot wallet's private key and RPC URL
3. **Configure settings** - Set vault/market addresses, recipient address, and monitoring interval
4. **Automated monitoring** - The bot continuously checks and executes withdrawals when liquidity is available


### Available Rescue Modes

Learn more about each mode:
- **[Vault Redeem](./docs/vault-redeem.md)** - Withdraw from ERC-4626 vaults with delegate/non-delegate options
- **[Morpho Market Withdraw](./docs/morpho-market-withdraw.md)** - Withdraw from Morpho lending markets

## Advanced Usage

### Direct Script Mode

Requires a `.env` file with `PRIVATE_KEY` and `RPC_URL`.
